The story of Reaper of Souls follows the events of Diablo III, where the Prime Evil Diablo was defeated by the Nephalem, a powerful hero. However, a new threat emerges in the form of Malthael, the fallen angel of wisdom, who has become the angel of death. Malthael plans to use the Black Soulstone, which contains the essence of all seven evils, to end the eternal conflict between angels and demons by wiping out all of humanity. The Nephalem must stop Malthael and his army of reapers before they destroy the world of Sanctuary.
 
The expansion introduces the Crusader class, a holy warrior who wields a shield and a flail. The Crusader has access to various skills and abilities that enhance their defense, offense, and mobility. The Crusader can also use wrath, a resource that is generated by attacking enemies and spent on powerful attacks. The Crusader is a versatile and durable class that can adapt to different situations and playstyles.
 
The level cap in Reaper of Souls is raised from 60 to 70, allowing players to unlock new skills and runes for their characters. The expansion also adds a new game mode called Adventure Mode, which lets players explore any area in the game without following the story. In Adventure Mode, players can complete bounties, which are random objectives that reward gold, experience, and blood shards. Blood shards can be used to buy items from a new vendor called Kadala. Adventure Mode also features Nephalem Rifts, which are randomized dungeons that contain enemies from different areas and bosses. Nephalem Rifts offer greater rewards and challenges than normal areas.
 
Reaper of Souls also improves the loot system of Diablo III, making it more rewarding and satisfying. The expansion reduces the amount of items that drop, but increases their quality and relevance to the player's class. The expansion also introduces legendary items that have unique effects and can change the way a skill works. Additionally, players can use the Mystic, a new artisan who can enchant items and change their appearance.
 
Reaper of Souls is a thrilling expansion that adds more depth and variety to Diablo III. The expansion offers a compelling story, a fun new class, a challenging new game mode, and a revamped loot system that makes every item drop exciting. Reaper of Souls is a must-have for fans of Diablo III and action role-playing games in general.

If you want to experience the full potential of Reaper of Souls, you should also try the online multiplayer mode, where you can team up with up to three other players and share the loot and the fun. You can also join clans and communities, which are groups of players who share common interests and goals. Clans and communities can chat, trade, and play together. You can also participate in seasons, which are periods of time where players start fresh characters and compete for leaderboard rankings and exclusive rewards. Seasons add a new layer of challenge and replayability to Reaper of Souls.
 
Reaper of Souls is not only an expansion, but also a major update that improves the core gameplay of Diablo III. The expansion fixes many issues and complaints that players had with the original game, such as the lack of endgame content, the boring loot system, and the auction house. Reaper of Souls makes Diablo III more fun, more balanced, and more rewarding. It also adds more content, more features, and more options for players to customize their characters and their gameplay.
 
Reaper of Souls is a worthy successor to the Diablo franchise, which is known for its addictive and satisfying action role-playing gameplay. Reaper of Souls delivers on its promise of providing a dark and epic adventure that will keep you hooked for hours. Whether you are a veteran or a newcomer to Diablo III, you will find something to enjoy in Reaper of Souls. Reaper of Souls is one of the best expansion packs ever made, and it deserves a place in your gaming library.
